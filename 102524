malloc(size) : returns to newly-allocated HEAP MEMORY of size byte. Crucial feature is that HEAP MEMORY is far away from STACK MEMORY, 
and malloc guarantees that the caller gets exclusive access to that memory.

When would we use heap vs. stack memory?
â†’ When the data will outlive the current function call, it MUST be heap memory (or copied on return)

calloc(count, size) : returns count * size.
